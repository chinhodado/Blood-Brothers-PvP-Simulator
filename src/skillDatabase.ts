/**
 * Some notes:
 * - For attack skills, there has to be a "ward" attribute, which takes a value of 1 (physical), 2 (magical) or 3 (breath)
 *   Counter skills also need the above, even though the ward will always be 1 for those skills
 * - If an arg is 0, there's no need to include it
 *
 * - There is no need for the baseProbability
